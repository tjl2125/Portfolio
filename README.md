# HW2-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

## Description 
From the perspective of a potential employee, I present a website that acts as a deployed portfolio which
displays a small description of myself, examples of previous projects I had worked on, methods of 
contacting me, and a way of getting my resume. The website provides the basic information about myself
so that an employer can get an idea of what I am capable of doing and if I would be a good fit for their
business, as well as providing a way to look more into myself through my contacts and resume. I had some 
trouble in getting certain things working such as the formatting and styling since I do not have much
background in art, but I was still able to accomplish making a decent layout. I used filler information
on this website since I would prefer to focus on the html and css.
